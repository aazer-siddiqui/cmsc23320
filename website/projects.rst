General
~~~~~~~

Make sure you read the following before working on any of the projects:

* **Supported software environments**: We can only provide support for work performed
  on a CS Linux machine or using a `CS Virtual Machine <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:index>`_
  (version 201920.2 or higher). If you use any other software environment, it is your
  responsibility to test your work on a supported environment before submitting your code.

  Note: The CS Virtual Machine is **required** to complete Project 3 (this project uses
  a network simulator that requires root access on a Linux machine, and the easiest way to
  provide this to you is through a virtual machine). Even if you don't plan on using the virtual
  machine for Projects 1 and 2, you may want to ensure (well ahead of Project 3) that
  you are able to install and use the virtual machine.

  Please note that you will not be required to do all your coding inside the virtual machine in Project 3.
  It will be possible for you to continue to develop your code on your own machine, and to use the virtual
  machine just to run the network simulator. In fact, you can run the VM in
  `headless mode <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:headless>`_ so it basically
  operates as a Linux server that you can SSH into (and share files with) from your own computer.

* `Using Git <git.html>`_: If you are unfamiliar with Git, read this first.
* `Registering for the projects <registering.html>`_: Before you start working on
  each project, there are some steps you need to take to register for each project.
* `Uploading the initial code to your repository <initial_code.html>`_: We provide starter
  code for all the projects. To upload this code to your repository, make sure to follow 
  the instructions described in this page.
* `Submitting a project <submit.html>`_: This page explains how to submit your projects,
  including how to use your extensions.
* `Style Guide <style_guide.html>`_: Conventions for writing C code in this class.

The following are resources that you may find helpful when working on your projects:

* `Working in Pairs <working_in_pairs.html>`__: This page provides a number of concrete
  suggestions and strategies for working effectively as a pair in the projects.
* `The Debugging Guide <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/>`_: A guide with useful suggestions and pointers on how to debug your C code.
* `Asking Effective Questions <questions.html>`_: A guide to asking effective questions on Piazza.
* `Using Continuous Integration <ci.html>`_


Project 1: chirc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, you will implement a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
server called chirc. This project has three goals:

#. To learn how to program with sockets, as well as some basic concurrent programming
   (including refreshing some concepts covered in CMSC 15400)

#. To implement a system that is (partially) compliant with an
   established network protocol specification.

#. To allow you to become comfortable with high-level networking
   concepts before we move on to the lower-level concepts in this
   course.

The project specification is available `here <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/>`_. Please
note that you will be implementing the following "assignments" from the chirc specification:

- Project 1a: Assignment 1
- Project 1b: Assignment 4
- Project 1c: Assignment 5

Make sure you read the `Project 1 rubric <project1_rubric.html>`_ and the `Project 1 tips <project1_tips.html>`_.

Project 2: chitcp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project you will be implementing the Transmission Control Protocol, as
specified in `[RFC793] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`__. However, instead
of implementing it inside the operating system itself, you will be implementing
it inside a system called chiTCP. This system allows you to write socket-based
applications that rely on your TCP implementation instead of the one included
in your operating system. To do this, chiTCP provides an alternate socket
library, chisocket, that provides the same functions as the standard socket
library (``connect``, ``send``, ``recv``, etc.). Although the chisocket
functions have the same expected behaviour as the standard socket functions,
they do not implement the entire functionality provided by standard sockets
(e.g., non-blocking sockets are not supported).

The project specification is available `here <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chitcp/>`__.

Make sure you read the `Project 2 rubric <project2_rubric.html>`_ and the `Project 2 tips <project2_tips.html>`_.


Project 3: chirouter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project you will be implementing a simple IP router capable of routing IPv4 datagrams between multiple networks. This router will have a static routing table, so you will not have to deal with implementing a routing protocol like RIP or OSPF; instead, the project will focus on the routing of IP datagrams. While, at a high level, this just involves receiving IP datagrams and figuring out what interface they should be sent on, this requires building additional functionality before you can actually start routing IP datagrams.

The project specification is available `here <http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/>`__.

Make sure you read the `Project 3 rubric <project3_rubric.html>`_ and the `Project 3 tips <project3_tips.html>`_.

Take into account that this project requires using a network simulator that
needs to be run with root privileges on a Linux machine. If you do not have
access to such a machine, you can use the `CS Virtual Machine <https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/vm:index>`_
(version 201920.2 or higher) to run the network simulator.
